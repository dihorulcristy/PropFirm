Reasonable Salary: $50,000
Distributions: $50,000

Self-Employment Tax on Salary Only:
$50,000 × 15.3% = $7,650

$100,000 × 15.3% = $15,300
Savings: $7,650 per year
```

**Note**: Consult a CPA before forming an S-Corp!

### 2. Maximize Retirement Contributions

```

### 3. Health Insurance Deduction

**Example**:
```
