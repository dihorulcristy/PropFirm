                "question": "What is a prop trading firm?",
                "answer": "A proprietary trading firm (prop firm) provides capital to talented traders to trade on financial markets. In exchange for an evaluation fee and demonstrating your skills, traders can keep a significant percentage of the profits generated (usually between 80% and 90%)."
            },
            {
                "question": "How does the evaluation process work?",
                "answer": "Most firms require traders to pass a 1 or 2-phase evaluation. You need to reach a profit target without violating drawdown rules (maximum loss). Once you pass the test, you receive a funded account."
            },
            {
                "question": "What are the main rules?",
                "answer": "Common rules include: Maximum Daily Drawdown (how much you can lose in a day), Maximum Total Drawdown (how much you can lose in total from the account), and sometimes trading restrictions during major economic news events."
            },
            {
                "question": "How fast can I withdraw profits?",
                "answer": "Each firm has its own policy. Some allow withdrawals every 14 days, others monthly, and some even weekly or on-demand after the first withdrawal."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is automated trading (EA) allowed?",
                "answer": "Many firms allow the use of Expert Advisors (EAs), but often with the condition that it must be your own strategy and not a public arbitrage EA or HFT (High Frequency Trading) that exploits server latency."
